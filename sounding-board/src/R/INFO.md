# Info

Currently, there are multiple versions of R scripts. The reason is you need a different script for the dashboards (since different calculations and estimations are made).
Every folder here is another place or occasion:
 - berlin: pathway options (2035), final (2045) (current version)
 - ccc: created for ECCC workshop in 2023, here are R scripts for freight, special transport
 - gladbeck: R script by Rybczak
